I am currently enrolled in a dual bachelor's degree program, having studied Industrial Engineering for three years at Incheon National University and now pursuing Management Information Systems at Weber State University. I am expected to graduate from both institutions in the spring of 2025.

My research goal is to enable the safe and reliable integration of intelligent and adaptable AI agents or robots into society, especially those capable of effecitvely nacigating unfamiliar situations. This vision stems from my academic experiences, which have fueld my passion for creating AI systems that can independently determine what needs to be done, identify gaps in knowldege, and learn how to address them effciently and effectively. I am particularly interested in building end-to-end pipelines that support problem understanding, adaptive learning, and decisive action. To achieve this, I aim to leverage advanced techniques such as mahcine learning, reinforcement learning, and robotics skills.
