I am currently enrolled in a <b>dual bachelor's degree program</b>, having studied <b>Industrial and Management Engineering</b> for three years at Incheon National University and now pursuing <b>Management Information Systems</b> at Weber State University. I am expected to graduate from both institutions in the spring of 2025.

My research goal is to enable the <b>safe</b> and <b>reliable integration</b> of <b>intelligent, adaptable AI agents</b> and <b>robots</b> into society, particularly those designed to effectively <b>navigate unfamiliar situations.</b>

This vision is rooted in my academic journey, which has fueled my passion for creating AI systems capable of independently determining <b>what needs to be done</b>, identifying <b>knowledge gaps</b>, and <b>learning how to address</b> them efficiently. I am especially interested in developing <b>end-to-end pipelines</b> that integrate problem understanding, adaptive learning, and decisive action. To achieve this, I leverage advanced techniques in machine learning, reinforcement learning, and robotics to build intelligent systems that are both effective and trustworthy.
