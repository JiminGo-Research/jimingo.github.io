Based on this work, our team published <a href="/assets/pdf/patent_certification.pdf">patent</a> and awarded an 19th Industrial Engineering Project Competition hosted by Korean Institute of Industrial Engineers(KIIE).</p> <p><b>Purpose of this study : </b></p> <p>This study was initiated to address the challenges faced by a <a href="http://www.ik-tech.co.kr/eng/" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener">company</a> in South Korea that manufactures and sells plating line. When a request is made to create a plating line capable of producing a specific type of plating within given seconds, <b>the company currently tests its feasibility based solely on the expertise and experience of professionals, without any system in place.</b> The company mentioned that manual scheduling takes anywhere from 3 days to over a week, and <b>they were looking for ways to reduce this time</b>. Additionally, due to the manual nature of the scheduling process, <b>mistakes have occured, such as failing to identify opportunites to reduce the number of hoists.</b></p> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-sm-6 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/electroplating_1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/electroplating_1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/electroplating_1-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/electroplating_1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="example image" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm-6 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/electroplating_2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/electroplating_2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/electroplating_2-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/electroplating_2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="example image" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Left image shows the actual plating line manufactured by the company.

A program that automatically designs plating lines</b> Since the company faced an urgent need to reduce the time required for plating line design, it was clear that an automated system was necessary. We viewed this problem as a type of flow shop scheduling and decided to develop a rule-based algorithm to quickly find a solution.</p> <p><b>2. A program for ananlyzing scheduling results</b> Due to reliance on experts, it was difficult to explain to clients why certain designs were necessary to meet given requirement. As shown in the figure above, the scheduling result chart used by the company was not easy to understand at a glance. Therefore, we decided to develop a bottleneck analysis tool and a more user-friendly Gantt chart.</p> <p><b>3. Graphic User Interface (GUI)</b> To help the worker understand how the scheduling results actually functioned and enable manufacturing on the factory, we also decided to develop a GUI.</p> <p><b>Problem definition : </b></p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/electroplating_3-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/electroplating_3-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/electroplating_3-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/electroplating_3.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="example image" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Example of electroplating line considered by this research </div> <p>Here are some <b>assumptions</b> and <b>constraints</b> necessary to understand the problem:</p> <ol> <li>Each workpiece goes through all the stages present in the plating line sequentially, and after a process is completed, it moves to the next tank.</li> <li>Each tank can process only one workpiece at a time, and if the deeping time falls outside the range betweeen the minimum and maximum deeping time, the item is considered defective.</li> <li>Each hoist can transport only one workpiece at a time, and it is assumed that there will be no stops during the transport process.</li> <li>Hoists must be operated with at least one tank gap between tank.</li> <li>hoists move at high, medium, or low speed depending on the travel distance, and it takes 10 seconds for ascending and descending</li> <li>If a stage has a significantly longer immersion time compared to others, parallel tanks may be used.</li> <li>Hoist overlapping is allowed when the turnover point is determined in parallel tanks.</li> <li>If the immersion time in a tank is less than 5 seconds, it cannot be a turnover point.</li> <li>Up to three dummy tanks (empty tanks without chemicals, not used in the actual process but employed to avoid collisions between hoists) can be added.</li> </ol> <p><b>Our method : </b></p> <p>Unlike the company, which only considered the feasibility of a single solution, we aim to present <b>a variety of feasible solutions that could emerge from different combinations of factors</b> such as the number of hoists, number of tanks, number of parallel tanks, number of dummy tanks, cycle time, and the deeping time of each tank.</p> <p>We named this method <b>Optimized Operation Planning for Plating (OOPP) Engine.</b> This consist of 4 steps: Understanding the situation -&gt; Diagnotic analysis -&gt; Operational strategy improvement -&gt; Deriving optimal operational strategy.

Once the turnover point is determined, the hoist paths are decided by considering the movements of neighboring hoists within the defined turnover point.

This has eliminated the need to consult external vendors when assessing design suitability, resulting in significant time savings. After nearly a year of hard work, the project has been successfully completed, and it is truly rewarding to see the tangible benefits it brings to the company.</p> <p><b>Reflection : </b> This project holds a special place for me personally because it marked several firsts. It was my first collaboration with a company, my first leading project in the lab, and it provided opportunities to present our research at conferences, file patents, and even win awards. There were countless development iterations before we finalized the OOPP Engine and CTS algorithm.</p> <p>Previous research had mostly focused on reducing cycle time, so there were limited references, and developing an algorithm that could account for all real-world constraints was no easy task. Reflecting on the journey, I realize how deeply immersed I was in the research—consulting with other labs, seeking advice on the challenges I encountered, and dedicating hours to the mathematical formulations. Despite many setbacks and failures, the time I spent relentlessly asking, “How can we improve?” led to immense personal and professional growth.</p> <p>I am currently designing experiments to tackle this project using reinforcement learning. If you are interested in the research we have conducted or the research I am planning to pursue, feel free to reach out with any questions.</p> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 You R.
